This is a small machine learning project that uses the University of California Machine Learning Repository's 17th dataset, Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic). It analyzes the correlating features of tumor cells, and uses a decision tree algorithm to determine whether a tumorous cell is malignant or benign, depending on the analysis conducted by the computer
